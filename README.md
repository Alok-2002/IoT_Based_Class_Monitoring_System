# IoT_Based_Class_Monitoring_System
This repository contains all the code, diagrams, and documentation for an IoT-based classroom noise monitoring system using NodeMCU, RFID, and a webcam. It allows real-time noise detection, teacher presence tracking, and dashboard viewing. Everything you need to deploy and run the project is organized here.
